# Basic GPIO with node.js
This is a basic example of GPIO control on the rasperry pi using the pi-pins module from npm

In this example we have a LED on pin 22 which will light up when the button is pressed on pin 17 and switch off when pressed again.

All you need to do is :

* clone this repo locally and cd into the folder.
* connect up the pi as shown in the diagram
* using [balena cli](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli), run `balena push <projectName>` wait a minute or so for the code to upload and start.
* enjoy the all the LED goodness...
